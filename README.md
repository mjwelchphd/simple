# starter
A starter web server with authentication, sessions, postgres, static and dynamic pages, testing, email, logging, and PayPal.

This is a new project which is intended to be a starter project for a beginner.

I will be adding parts to it as I figure out how to implement each one. As I add each part, I'll document it here.
